    "Recent development of meta learning has driven the industry to a complete different trajectory compared to the ordinary and traditional learning algorithms. In ordinary way, we have fixed learning algorithms to perform specific tasks. But in meta learning, we try to improve the learning algorithm so that it is able to perform a range of tasks from the same distribution."

To start with the task, we will need a dataset _D_ that is consisting of tuples of (x, y) where x refers to data points and y refers to labels. Then, we train a predictive model to predict labels; $\\hat{y}$ = $f_{\\theta}$(x). Note that the model is parameterized by $\\theta$. We tarin the predictive model by solving;"

And we try to minimize the loss by adapting the parameters $\\theta$ to get the optimal set of parameters $\\theta^{*}$. The _w_ here refers to initial assumptions we made of optimization and learning function. This is what meta learning try to tackle. Instead of having a fixed w, what if we implement an algorithm that can learn to choose the best _w_ when a new task is given? In that way, we will be able to generalize our learning algorithms for a range of tasks.  "

In the training step, we assume a a set _M_ of relatable tasks sampled from _p_(_T_). Then, we have a collection of tasks same as we have a collection of data points and labels in the conventional way.
